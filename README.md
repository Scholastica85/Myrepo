- More on Variable
- In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator (=).

```myVariable = 5;```

- After a value is assigned to a variable using the assignment operator, you can assign the value of that variable to another variable using the assignment operator.

```var myVar;
myVar = 5;
var myNum;
myNum = myVar;```
