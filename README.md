**More on Variable**
- In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator (=).

```myVariable = 5;```

- After a value is assigned to a variable using the assignment operator, you can assign the value of that variable to another variable using the assignment operator.
  
```
var myVar;
myVar = 5;
var myNum;
myNum = myVar;
```

**Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables**

- In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters.
- MYVAR is not the same as MyVar nor myvar. It is possible to have multiple distinct variables with the same name but different casing. It is strongly recommended that for the sake of clarity, you do not use this language feature.

**Best Practice**

- Write variable names in JavaScript in camelCase. Example ```var someVariable;```

**Number operations**
- + sign for addition
- (-) sign for substraction
- (*) sign for multiplication
- (/) sign for division

**Increment a Number with JavaScript**
- You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the ++ operator.
Example
```i++;```
is the equivalent of
```i = i + 1;```
**Decrement a Number with JavaScript**
- You can easily decrement or decrease a variable by one with the -- operator.
Example
i--;
is the equivalent of

i = i - 1;
Note: The entire line becomes i--;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.
